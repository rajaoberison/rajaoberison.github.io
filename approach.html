                Use of satellite imagery
            </h1>
            <p>
                Landsat images between 1989-2017 will be used to analyze the changes in mangrove extent.
                Analysis will be performed in Google Earth Engine (GEE; Gorelick et al., 2017),
                using code originally developed by Jason Halden and Aurélie Shapiro and based on
                methodologies in Shapiro et al. (2015) and Green et al. (1998). First, clouds and
                cloud shadows in each of the images will be masked out, and the image collections will be
                reduced using the median reducer in GEE. The result will be a multiband image in which
                each pixel has the median value of all unmasked pixels in that location. As mangroves
                are not present at elevations greater than 30 m, these areas also be excluded.

                The Bayesian Approach
            </h1>
            <p>
                The bayesian approach relies on the Bayes theorem, which uses conditional probabilities
                to estimate the probability of a hypothesis given the evidence (or observed data). It
                has been widely applied in the field of remote sensing (Qu et al., 2008) and has been
                reported to be accurate in predicting forest loss (Mayfield et al. 2017). In this study,
                I will particularly attempt to infer the extent of mangrove loss/gain based on natural
                and anthropogenic set of predictors. My approach will be to classify mangroves and
                terrestrial land covers in a 5-year interval, from 1995 to 2015 using Landsat imagery
                (or use the available mangrove cover and land use datasets if satisfactory). I will then
                use these classified land covers as reference data for a new, solely, mangrove cover
                classification that will be based on a set of predictors such as:
            </p>
            <p>
                - Natural: hydrological change(precipitation, discharge, river flow), and upstream land
                cover (riparian vegetation, and extent of bare soil);
            </p>
            <p>
                - Anthropogenic: built-environment (road network and urban areas), direct mangrove
                deforestation (from mangrove resource use or conversion to other land uses), and
                restoration efforts (established protected areas and restoration projects).
            </p>
            <p>
                The likelihood of the newly classified mangrove cover will be calculated according to
                Bayes’ theorem, assuming independence between the set of predictors used.
            </p>
