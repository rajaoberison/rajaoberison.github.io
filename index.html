                MANGROVE FACTS AND FIGURES
            </h1>
            <p>
                Mangroves are one of the most productive, biodiverse but yet undervalued ecosystems
                (Thomas et al., 2017, Giri et. al., 2011). From 1980 to 2000, more than 35% of the worldâ€™s
                mangroves were lost Giri et. al., 2011. Drivers of these losses are either natural (changes
                in hydrology, sedimentation, natural hazards, etc.) or man-made (agriculture, coastal
                development, mangrove resource use) (Chowdhury, 2017). And any programs aimed at restoring
                mangroves has to specifically address the underlying (local) factors causing their loss.
                In this study, I will attempt to predict mangrove cover change based on adjacent land covers,
                hydrology, restoration efforts, and population changes over time and space, using a bayesian
                approach.

                 One of the greatest advantages to mangroves is their relationship with coastal fisheries.
                 In developping countries, successful mangrove restoration would always benefit fishermen communities.
