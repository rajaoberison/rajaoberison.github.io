Current projects:
-------------------------------
**Data Scientist, YPCCC**
Applying data analysis, programming, and spatial analysis tools to support the analysis of social and geospatial data for climate change research and communication.

- Exploring hurricane survey data and engineering spatial features to study the factors affecting coastal resident's evacuation behaviors. Developed an ArcGIS toolbox that calculates the distance to coastlines of survey point data.
- Developing a watershed delineation tool for lakes and collecting additional data for a global analysis of lakes' charcoal content.

**GIS Programmer / Analyst, Yale FES**
Applying spatial analysis, data mining, and economic tools to facilitate the economic assessment of coastal defense plan against storm surges along the US East Coast.

- Developing a geospatial tool for coastal flooding impacts assessment along the US east coast using ArcGIS's arcpy library, and currently exploring open-source software and web-based options;
- Translating Excel economic models into an ArcGIS python script.
