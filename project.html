                Making predictions of mangrove deforestation: a comparison of two methods in Kenya (Alasdair et al., 2013)
            </p>
            <p>
                Deforestation of mangroves is of global concern given their importance for carbon storage,
                biogeochemical cycling and the provision of other ecosystem services, but the links between rates
                of loss and potential drivers or risk factors are rarely evaluated. Here, we identified key drivers
                of mangrove loss in Kenya and compared two different approaches to predicting risk. Risk factors tested
                included various possible predictors of anthropogenic deforestation, related to population, suitability
                for land use change and accessibility. Two approaches were taken to modelling risk; a quantitative
                statistical approach and a qualitative categorical ranking approach. A quantitative model linking rates
                of loss to risk factors was constructed based on generalized least squares regression and using
                mangrove loss data from 1992 to 2000. Population density, soil type and proximity to roads were the
                most important predictors. In order to validate this model it was used to generate a map of losses of
                Kenyan mangroves predicted to have occurred between 2000 and 2010. The qualitative categorical model
                was constructed using data from the same selection of variables, with the coincidence of different risk
                factors in particular mangrove areas used in an additive manner to create a relative risk index which
                was then mapped. Quantitative predictions of loss were significantly correlated with the actual loss of
                mangroves between 2000 and 2010 and the categorical risk index values were also highly correlated with
                the quantitative predictions. Hence, in this case the relatively simple categorical modelling approach
                was of similar predictive value to the more complex quantitative model of mangrove deforestation. The
                advantages and disadvantages of each approach are discussed, and the implications for mangroves are
                outlined.

                Predicting the spatial distribution of mangroves in a South African estuary in response to sea
                level rise, substrate elevation change and a sea storm event (Yang et al., 2013)
            </p>
            <p>
                The spatial distribution of mangroves in the Mngazana Estuary under sea level rise induced by
                climate change, together with different substrate elevation change scenarios was predicted for
                2020,2050 and 2100. The present inundation frequency tolerance range was from 0.8 to 31.2 %,
                equivalent to substrate elevation thresholds of 1.1 and 1.7 m amsl. These thresholds were measured
                by field surveys and analysis of a gauge station situated near the mouth of the estuary.
                The predictions were based on the assumption that the inundation frequency tolerance range of mangrove
                stands remains constant in the future. Through the use of a digital elevation model an initial
                increase of 2.10 ha year-1 was found in mangrove area between present and 2020 (from 122.6 to 143.6 ha).
                This was due to habitat becoming available that is currently too compacted for seedling establishment
                to occur. This compaction resulted from human and cattle traffic for grazing. Thereafter there would
                be a mean loss of 0.66 ha year-1 from 2020 through 2100. Landward migration of mangroves would not
                take place due to the elevation limit of adjacent non-mangrove areas. In addition, the loss rate would
                increase to 1.01 ha year-1 under insufficient sediment accretion, but would decrease to 0.18 ha per year
                under thriving mangroves condition. The analysis of sea storm event in September 2008 showed that
                local water level increased by 28 cm and maximum affected area was 87.0 ha (about 71 % of mangrove
                stands). The inundation continued over 5 days. The results indicated that the combination impact of
                sea level rise, substrate elevation change and sea storm would possibly be a threat to tropical
                African estuaries with large flat intertidal areas and mangroves.
